# hmc
Proof of concept implementation for **HMC** (Home Media Cloud) architecture, which allows multiple Android devices to securely communicate and control each other in order to share multimedia content. The system relies on an XMPP server for sending the signaling messages which are end-to-end encrypted. Devices that can securely exchange content are added to a private "network" when the user approves and verifies their authenticity.
